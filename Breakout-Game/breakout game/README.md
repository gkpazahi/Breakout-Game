# Breakout 2K25

Welcome to Breakout 2K25, a classic arcade-style brick-breaking game built using Python and Pygame.
Control a paddle to bounce a ball and break all the bricks on the screen.
This game includes multiple enhancements to the original Atari arcade game Breakout, including power-ups, special effects, and an authentication system for players to save high scores.

#  Features

Power-ups: Special bricks drop power-ups, such as increasing paddle size, slowing down the ball, or granting extra lives.

Visual Effects: Particles and fragments appear when bricks are broken. A trail of fire follows the ball wherever it goes. Falling stars decorate the background.

User Authentication: Players can log in or register to track their scores.

Background Music & Sounds: Retro music and sound effects create a lively, nostalgic atmosphere.

Multiple Levels: Each new level brings more challenging brick layouts and speed.
